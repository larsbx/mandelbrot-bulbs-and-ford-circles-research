"""Directed rounding to bounded-precision dyadic rationals, exactly.

Specification section 2.1 (docs/rational-interval-arithmetic-spec.md in the
consumers) admits an endpoint set ``E = F`` with directed rounding -- lower
endpoints toward minus infinity, upper toward plus infinity. A dyadic
rational ``m / 2^s`` with a numerator of about ``precision`` bits is the same
idea done exactly: the rounding direction is a floor or a ceiling over ``Z``,
decided rather than configured, so no hardware rounding mode is involved.

The exact backend never rounds, so coefficients grow without bound; directed
rounding is what lets a consumer trade width for size. Nothing here loses
soundness: ``round_down(x) <= x <= round_up(x)`` always, and an outward
rounded interval contains the one it came from.

Ported from larsbx/finite-julia-set-research reference/dyadic.py with its
names and its convention that a ``precision`` below one means "do not round"
(the identity, which is exact and therefore sound). Different here: a float
argument is refused with ``TypeError`` rather than converted. Precision must
be a non-boolean ``int``, including on zero and rejected-interval paths, and
``round_outward`` refuses a reversed pair ``lo > hi`` with ``ValueError``
rather than returning a reversed pair.

What is claimed: the directed inequalities, and that the result is
``m / 2^s`` with ``s = scale_for(x, precision)`` and ``|m| <= 2^precision``.
What is not: that it is the nearest such dyadic in any sense beyond the
stated floor and ceiling.
