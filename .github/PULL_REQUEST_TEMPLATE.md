Derived from templates/github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md in larsbx/agent-icm @ sha256:1e174a33ab48cac7
Edit the canonical template or estate.toml in larsbx/agent-icm, then re-render there: make estate
Hand-edits here are drift, and agent-icm's `make estate-check` fails on them.

## What changed

<!-- The behaviour change, in one or two sentences. Not the effort — the difference. -->

## Why

<!-- The problem, and why this is the shape of the fix. Link the issue, spec item, decision record or task id. -->

## Evidence

<!--
Paste what you ran and what it said. A check you did not run is not evidence;
say so plainly rather than leaving the line blank.
-->

## What this does *not* establish

<!--
Required. Name the bound.
 - A search that stopped at a limit says where it stopped.
 - A refusal is not a clean answer.
 - A test that could not run is not a test that passed.
 - Claim exactly what the run, the proof or the certificate establishes — no more.
Write "nothing outstanding" only if that is true.
-->

## Risk and reversibility

<!-- What breaks if this is wrong, and how it is backed out. -->
